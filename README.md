Link to Website: https://keurig-2.web.app/

This is the Keurig Website Final that I have created. I used a JSON file that has the different coffee makers and diplayed the coffee makers onto divs. I made the buttons work so that when you click on the buy now button, it adds a number to the car which shows that an item has been purchased. It uses URL Navigation as well as an mvc model with view injection so that it uses one page navigation. The website is also responsive. The website uses firebase and also allows for people to create accounts and login whenever they want to. I made this website because I believe that it will hep me work on some of the skills that I am lacking in. For example, I am not the best when it comes to making responsive web pages, by creating this website, it has allowed me to try and imporve my skills when it comes to making websites more responsive.
